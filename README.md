Authorization: Bearer job_seeker_token
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
    "resume": [file]
}
```
- Uploads resume
- Creates pending application
- Application status: "pending_payment"

2. **Process Payment**
```http
POST http://localhost:5000/api/applications/:job_id/:user_id/payment
Authorization: Bearer job_seeker_token
Content-Type: application/json

- No real money transactions
- Payment status is automatically approved
- For production: Integrate with real payment gateway

### Error Handling
